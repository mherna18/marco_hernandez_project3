<p id="sports">The images below are Chicago's sports team. They are all professional leagues and are some of my favorite teams to watch.
I am more of a basketball fan so the Chicago Bulls are my favorite team. I do keep up with the other sport teams since I am 
into sports. That is why I have provided the links to each of the teams sites to get people updated on the latest news and 
tickets if anyone is interested. As of now it is baseball season so the Chicago Cubs will have tickets but the Chicago 
Bears are selling tickets too. Their season hasn't started but preseason starts in August so it's coming soon.</p>
<p>If you click on the pictures on the right it will direct you to their offical sites where you can
buy tickets for games, latest news, roster and many more!</p>
