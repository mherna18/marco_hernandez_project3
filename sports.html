<p id="sports">The images below are Chicago's sports team. They are all professional leagues and are some of my favorite teams to watch.
I am more of a basketball fan so the Chicago Bulls are my favorite team. I do keep up with the other sport teams since I am 
into sports. That is why I have provided the links to each of the teams sites to get people updated on the latest news and 
tickets if anyone is interested. As of now it is baseball season so the Chicago Cubs will have tickets but the Chicago 
Bears are selling tickets too. Their season hasn't started but preseason starts in August so it's coming soon.</p>
<p>If you click on the pictures on the right it will direct you to their offical sites where you can
buy tickets for games, latest news, roster and many more!</p>

<p>The slide show below are a few pictures that I took myself while I was at some of the games. I've been
to all the stadiums in Chicago but so more than others. Each experience was different and it's always
exciting to watch these teams play live at the stadium. I've been to the United Center more which is more
the Chicago Bulls and Blackhawks play. I've been to many Bulls games but only a handful of Blackhawk games. 
The Cubs I use to go see them play more when I was younger but not so much now. The Bears I try to go when 
I can because I don't ever get tickets to see them play.  The pictures are from different games so it's not
just one game so the crowd and atmosphere is different in most of the pictures.</p>
